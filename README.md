## AIE211 Introduction to Computer Networks

##  Proxy Server for Network Monitoring and Restriction

The Product that we will be developing is a Proxy Server for Network Monitoring and Filtering. The main purpose of this proxy server is to restrict access to unethical websites by the students. The Proxy Server will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi and the filtering will be based on a large dataset of hostnames. 

The UN development goal that we are trying to solve is “Quality Education”. In this time of the COVID Pandemic the students are lacking the education they were receiving before, Reasons for this can be that there is no supervision of their online activity. To make sure that students are focused on attending their classes and not using the internet to browse anything else the Proxy we are developing can be used, by restricting the Websites accessible through the proxy server and monitoring its use.
